  <b>Explanation:</b> In this scenario, we are using observables. So if we
  update the parent data, it automatically updates the child data as well and
  this is happening because we are using Async Pipe in the child component which
  automatically re-renders the UI. Parent is not updating from the child because
  we are assigning completely different observable to that value. Now, if we
  want to have an updated data in both components, we can simply use the service
  and it won't matter from which component we'll change the data. It will be
  updated because we will be using Async pipe in the parent component as well as
  in the child component.

<h2>Parent Component</h2>

<span>Parent Data: {{ data$ | async }}</span>

<button (click)="changeData()">Update Parent Data</button>

<br />
<br />

<span>Data from Service: {{ serviceData$ | async }}</span>
<button (click)="updateServiceData()">Update From Parent</button>

<br />

<app-sc-five-child [childData]="data$"></app-sc-five-child>
